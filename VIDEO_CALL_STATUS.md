# 🎉 Video Call Feature - Status Update

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED!**

### Problem Encountered

**Error:** "Tried to modify a provider while the widget tree was building"

This error occurred because the video call initialization was attempting to modify the Riverpod provider state during the `initState()` lifecycle method, which happens during the widget build phase.

### Solution Applied

✅ **Fixed** by using `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()` to defer the provider modification until after the first frame is built.

**Change made in:** `lib/features/video_call/presentation/pages/video_call_page.dart`

```dart
// BEFORE (caused error):
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _initializeCall(); // ❌ Modifies provider during build
}

// AFTER (fixed):
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WakelockPlus.enable();

  // ✅ Defers initialization until after first frame
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    _initializeCall();
  });
}
```

## 📊 Current Status

### Build Status: ✅ **PASSING**

- No compilation errors
- 4 minor deprecation warnings (non-critical)
- All features implemented and working

### Analyzer Results

```
4 issues found (all info-level deprecation warnings):
- 'value' deprecated in register.dart (existing issue)
- 'withOpacity' deprecated (3 instances) - cosmetic only
```

These are minor warnings about deprecated methods in Flutter SDK and don't affect functionality.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture Pattern

```
Clean Architecture:
├── Data Layer: AgoraService (RTC engine management)
├── Domain Layer: CallState (business models)
└── Presentation Layer: Pages, Providers, Widgets (UI & state)
```

### State Management

- **Provider**: Riverpod StateNotifier
- **State Model**: Immutable CallState with copyWith
- **Lifecycle**: Proper initialization and disposal

### Key Fix Applied

**Problem:** Provider modification during build phase  
**Solution:** Deferred initialization with `addPostFrameCallback`  
**Result:** ✅ No errors, clean initialization

# 🚨 RUN THIS NOW - Database Migration Required!

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM

Your prescriptions are being created but NOT showing because your database is missing the new columns!

**What's happening:**

- ✅ App code is updated and working
- ✅ Doctor ID is being passed correctly
- ❌ **Database doesn't have `doctor_id`, `consultation_id`, `diagnosis` columns yet**
- ❌ So the query returns 0 results!

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase

1. Go to **https://supabase.com**
2. Sign in to your account
3. Open your **DocSync project**

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor

1. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New Query"** button

### Step 3: Copy and Run the Migration

1. Open the file: **`update_existing_prescriptions_schema.sql`** in VS Code
2. **Select ALL** (Ctrl+A)
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C)
4. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
5. **Paste** (Ctrl+V)
6. Click **"Run"** or press Ctrl+Enter

### Step 4: Verify Success

You should see this output at the bottom:

```
✅ Prescriptions table updated successfully!
✅ Medical tests table created!
✅ RLS policies updated!
✅ You can now use the prescription feature in your app!
```

### Step 5: Hot Reload Your App

In your terminal:

```bash
r  # Press 'r' to hot reload
```

### Step 6: Check Prescriptions Tab

1. Open your app
2. Go to **Prescriptions** tab
3. **Your prescriptions should now appear!** 🎉

## 📊 What This Migration Does

1. **Adds new columns** to `prescriptions` table:

   - `consultation_id` - Links to consultation
   - `patient_id` - Patient reference
   - `doctor_id` - Doctor reference ← **THIS IS WHY IT'S NOT SHOWING**
   - `diagnosis` - Primary diagnosis
   - `symptoms` - Patient symptoms
   - `medical_notes` - Doctor's notes
   - `follow_up_date` - Follow-up appointment
   - `updated_at` - Last modified timestamp

2. **Creates `medical_tests` table**:

   - Links to prescriptions
   - Stores test orders

3. **Updates RLS Policies**:

   - Ensures doctors can only see their own prescriptions
   - Fixes security rules

4. **Adds Indexes**:
   - Makes queries faster

## ❓ Why This Happened

Your existing database has this structure:

```
prescriptions
  - id
  - health_record_id
  - created_at
```

But the app code is looking for:

```
prescriptions
  - id
  - health_record_id
  - created_at
  - doctor_id         ← MISSING!
  - consultation_id   ← MISSING!
  - diagnosis         ← MISSING!
  - ...
```

When the app queries `.eq('doctor_id', doctorId)`, it fails because `doctor_id` column doesn't exist!

## 🔍 Current State

**Your Database** (Before Migration):

```sql
prescriptions: [id, health_record_id, created_at]
```

**What App Needs** (After Migration):

```sql
prescriptions: [id, health_record_id, created_at, doctor_id, patient_id, consultation_id, diagnosis, symptoms, medical_notes, follow_up_date, updated_at]
```

## ✅ After Running Migration

1. ✅ Prescriptions will show in the list
2. ✅ New prescriptions will save with all data
3. ✅ Old prescriptions (if any) will still work
4. ✅ No data loss!

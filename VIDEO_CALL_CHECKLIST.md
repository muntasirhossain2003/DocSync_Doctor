## üìù Known Limitations

Current implementation:

- ‚úÖ Works with static token (development only)
- ‚úÖ Single channel for all calls
- ‚úÖ 1-on-1 calls only
- ‚úÖ Basic video quality settings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs dynamic token for production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs proper channel management for multiple calls
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs call recording implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs advanced quality controls

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test on Device**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Create Test Data**

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO consultations (patient_id, doctor_id, consultation_type, scheduled_time, consultation_status)
   VALUES ('patient-uuid', 'doctor-uuid', 'video', NOW(), 'scheduled');
   ```

3. **Grant Permissions**

   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Allow microphone access when prompted

4. **Test Call Flow**
   - Start a video call
   - Test all controls
   - End the call properly

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

Your video call feature is working if:

- ‚úÖ Doctor can see their own video (local preview)

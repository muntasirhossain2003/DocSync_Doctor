# ✅ FINAL FIX - Password Reset Token Expiration

## What I Fixed

Your app was failing because:

1. **Supabase is sending PKCE codes** (`?code=...`) instead of hash fragments
2. **The code wasn't being exchanged** for a session properly
3. **Error messages weren't helpful** - didn't explain expiration

### Code Changes Applied

✅ **`reset_password.dart`** now:

- Properly exchanges PKCE codes using `exchangeCodeForSession()`
- Detects expired tokens and shows clear error message
- Handles all auth errors gracefully
- Provides detailed debug logging

## 🎯 How To Test Now

### Step 1: Get the App Running

Wait for the terminal to show:

```
Flutter run key commands.
r Hot reload.
...
```

### Step 2: Request a Fresh Password Reset

**IMPORTANT**: Old reset links are EXPIRED. You must request a new one!

1. Go to your login page
2. Enter your email
3. Click "Forgot Password?"
4. Wait for success message

### Step 3: Check Your Email

1. Open your email inbox
2. Find the password reset email from Supabase
3. **Click the reset link immediately** (links expire after 1 hour)

### Step 4: Watch The Debug Console

In VS Code, check the Debug Console. You should see:

**If Successful:**

```
=== Password Reset Debug ===
Current URL: http://localhost:53249/reset_password?code=e9819d82-6870-4e23-aa93-0c78e6d155a7#/reset_password
Found recovery code in query params: e9819d82-6870-4e23...
=== Reset Password Page Loaded ===
Initial session check: NULL
No session found, checking for PKCE code...
Recovery token from URL: e9819d82-6870-4e23...
Attempting to exchange PKCE code for session...
✅ Successfully exchanged code! User: your@email.com
```

**Then you'll see the password reset form!**

**If Token Expired:**

```
❌ Auth error during code exchange: Token expired
```

**You'll see**: "Your reset link has expired. Password reset links are valid for 1 hour. Please request a new one."

## 🔴 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Your reset link has expired"

**Cause**: You clicked an old email link or waited too long (>1 hour)

**Solution**:

1. Go back to login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?" again
3. Get a NEW email
4. Click the link immediately

### Issue 2: Still shows "Invalid or expired" even with new link

**Cause**: Token might have expired during email delivery, or Supabase config issue

**Solution**:

1. Check your **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Look for **"JWT expiry limit"** - should be at least 3600 seconds (1 hour)
3. Request a fresh reset link

### Issue 3: "Authentication error: [some message]"

**Cause**: Supabase auth error

**Solution**:

1. Check the exact error message in the Debug Console
2. Verify your `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
3. Check Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Logs** for errors

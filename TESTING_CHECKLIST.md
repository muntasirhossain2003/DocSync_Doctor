## 🎯 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Create Prescription During Video Call

1. **Start a video call:**

   - Go to Consultations tab
   - Start a consultation with a patient
   - Wait for call to connect

2. **Create prescription while in call:**

   - While video call is active, click "Create Prescription" button
   - Fill in prescription:
     ```
     Diagnosis: Test headache prescription
     Medications: Add 2 medications (e.g., Paracetamol, Ibuprofen)
     Tests: Add 1 test (e.g., Blood test)
     Instructions: Rest and hydrate
     ```
   - Click Save

3. **Check logs immediately:**

   ```
   Look for:
   📝 Creating prescription...
      Consultation ID: [uuid]
      Patient ID: [uuid]
      Doctor ID: [uuid] ← MUST NOT BE NULL!
      Diagnosis: Test headache prescription
      Medications: 2
      Tests: 1
   📝 Creating prescription in database...
   ✅ Prescription inserted with ID: [uuid]
   💊 Inserting 2 medications...
   ✅ Medications inserted
   🧪 Inserting 1 tests...
   ✅ Tests inserted
   ✅ Prescription creation complete!
   ✅ Prescription created successfully!
   ```

4. **Return to video call:**

   - Press back button
   - Continue or end call

5. **Check prescriptions list:**
   - Navigate to Prescriptions tab
   - **NEW**: Page auto-refreshes on open!
   - Check logs:
     ```
     🏁 PrescriptionsPage initialized
     ♻️ Auto-refreshing prescriptions on page load
     🔄 PrescriptionsPage rebuilding...
        Status: Loading
     ✅ Current user auth_id: [uuid]
     ✅ User ID: [uuid]
     ✅ Doctor ID: [uuid] ← MUST MATCH prescription.doctor_id!
     📋 Prescriptions loaded: 1 items
        - Test headache prescription (ID: [uuid])
     ```
   - ✅ **You should see the prescription in the list!**

### Test 2: Manual Refresh

1. **If prescription doesn't appear:**
   - Click the refresh icon (top-right corner)
   - Check logs for:
     ```
     🔄 Manual refresh triggered
     [Same query logs as above]
     ```

### Test 3: Create Multiple Prescriptions

1. **Create 2-3 prescriptions** with different diagnoses
2. **Navigate to Prescriptions tab** after each one
3. **Verify count increases** each time

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:

1. **Creation Logs Show:**

   - ✅ Doctor ID is NOT null
   - ✅ Prescription inserted with valid UUID
   - ✅ Success message appears

2. **Display Logs Show:**

   - ✅ Doctor ID matches (same UUID as creation)
   - ✅ Prescriptions loaded: N items (N > 0)
   - ✅ Each prescription diagnosis listed

3. **UI Shows:**
   - ✅ Prescription card appears with diagnosis
   - ✅ Medications and tests counts visible
   - ✅ Can click to view details

### ❌ Failure Indicators:

1. **Doctor ID is NULL during creation:**

   ```
   📝 Creating prescription...
      Doctor ID: null ← PROBLEM!
   ```

   **Solution:** Doctor profile not loaded. Check profile page loads correctly.

2. **Doctor IDs don't match:**

   ```
   Creating: Doctor ID: abc123
   Querying: Doctor ID: xyz789 ← MISMATCH!
   ```

   **Solution:** Wrong doctor ID being used. Check doctor profile provider.

3. **Query returns empty:**

   ```
   ✅ Prescriptions query response: []
   📋 Prescriptions loaded: 0 items
   ```

   **Solution:** Check database directly with SQL queries in debug guide.

4. **Error during creation:**
   ```
   ❌ Failed to create prescription: [error message]
   ```
   **Solution:** Check error message. Likely database constraint or RLS policy.

## 📊 Database Verification

If prescriptions still don't appear, run these in Supabase SQL Editor:

### 1. Check Your Doctor ID:

```sql
SELECT
  u.auth_id,
  u.id as user_id,
  u.full_name,
  d.id as doctor_id
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON u.id = d.user_id
WHERE u.auth_id = auth.uid();
```

### 2. Check All Prescriptions:

```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.diagnosis,
  p.doctor_id,
  p.patient_id,
  p.created_at,
  d.user_id as doctor_user_id,
  du.full_name as doctor_name
FROM prescriptions p
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON p.doctor_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN users du ON d.user_id = du.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Check Your Prescriptions:

```sql
WITH current_doctor AS (
  SELECT d.id as doctor_id
  FROM users u
  JOIN doctors d ON u.id = d.user_id
  WHERE u.auth_id = auth.uid()
)
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.diagnosis,
  p.doctor_id,
  p.created_at
FROM prescriptions p, current_doctor
WHERE p.doctor_id = current_doctor.doctor_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

## 🎬 Recording Your Test

**When testing, copy and share:**

1. **Complete log output** from terminal
2. **Screenshots** of:
   - Create prescription form (filled)
   - Success message
   - Prescriptions list (empty or with items)
3. **Database query results** from above SQL queries

## 🚨 Priority Checks

**Before reporting issues, verify:**

1. ☑️ Doctor profile loads correctly (visit Profile tab)
2. ☑️ You're logged in as a doctor (not patient)
3. ☑️ Video call connects successfully
4. ☑️ Create prescription button appears during call
5. ☑️ Success message appears after saving prescription
6. ☑️ Check logs for the COMPLETE sequence above

## 📝 Key Improvements Made

1. **Auto-refresh on page load** - No more stale data
2. **Manual refresh button** - User can force refresh anytime
3. **Comprehensive logging** - Every step tracked with emoji icons
4. **StatefulWidget** - Better lifecycle management
5. **Post-frame callback** - Ensures refresh happens after build

## 🔮 Expected Behavior

**Normal Flow:**

```
User creates prescription →
  Database insert →
    Navigator.pop →
      User navigates to Prescriptions tab →
        Page initializes →
          Auto-refresh triggered →
            Query runs →
              Prescriptions load →
                Cards display ✅
```

**What was happening before:**

```
User creates prescription →
  Database insert →
    Navigator.pop →
      User navigates to Prescriptions tab →
        Page shows cached/old data →
          No refresh ❌

# Prescription System Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview

Complete prescription system with full CRUD functionality, allowing doctors to create prescriptions after video consultations.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### 1. Run the Schema SQL

Execute the file: `create_prescriptions_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor

This creates:

- ✅ `prescriptions` table
- ✅ `prescription_medications` table (one-to-many)
- ✅ `medical_tests` table (recommended tests)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Triggers for auto-updating timestamps

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Bottom Navigation**

✅ Added "Prescriptions" tab to `doctor_main_scaffold.dart`

- Icon: `Icons.medication`
- Shows list of all prescriptions created by doctor

### 2. **Prescriptions List Page**

Features:

- View all prescriptions
- Empty state with friendly message
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Display diagnosis, symptoms, medications count, tests count
- Show follow-up dates
- Formatted dates

### 3. **Create Prescription Page**

After ending a video call, doctors can:

- ✅ Enter diagnosis (required)
- ✅ Add symptoms
- ✅ Add medical notes
- ✅ Set follow-up date
- ✅ Add multiple medications with:
  - Medication name
  - Dosage (e.g., 500mg)
  - Frequency (e.g., 3 times daily)
  - Duration (e.g., 7 days)
  - Special instructions
- ✅ Add recommended medical tests with:
  - Test name
  - Reason for test
  - Urgency level (Routine/Normal/Urgent)
- ✅ Save prescription to database

### 4. **Post-Call Flow**

When a video call ends:

1. "Call Ended" screen appears
2. Two options shown:
   - **Create Prescription** (Green button)
   - **Go Back** (Outlined button)
3. Doctor can create prescription immediately
4. Or skip and return to consultations

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Doctors:

#### Creating a Prescription:

1. Complete a video consultation
2. When call ends, click "Create Prescription"
3. Fill in diagnosis (required)
4. Optionally add symptoms and notes
5. Click "Add" under Medications:
   - Enter medication details
   - Add multiple medications as needed
6. Click "Add" under Recommended Tests:
   - Enter test details
   - Set urgency level
7. Set follow-up date (optional)
8. Click "Save Prescription"

#### Viewing Prescriptions:

1. Go to "Prescriptions" tab in bottom navigation
2. See list of all created prescriptions
3. Pull down to refresh
4. Tap on prescription to view details (to be implemented)

## 🔧 TODO / Next Steps

### High Priority:

1. **Pass doctor_id correctly** in `CreatePrescriptionPage`

   - Currently showing empty string
   - Need to get from consultation or auth provider

2. **Prescription Detail Page**

   - View full prescription details
   - Edit existing prescription
   - Delete prescription
   - Print/Export prescription as PDF

3. **Patient View** (in Patient App)
   - Patients should see their prescriptions
   - Download/share prescription

### Medium Priority:

4. **Search & Filter**

   - Search prescriptions by diagnosis
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by patient name

5. **Templates**

   - Save common prescriptions as templates
   - Quick-add frequent medications

6. **Notifications**
   - Notify patient when prescription is created
   - Reminder for follow-up dates

### Low Priority:

7. **Analytics**
   - Most prescribed medications
   - Common diagnoses
   - Follow-up compliance

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Doctor ID Missing**: Need to fetch and pass doctor_id when creating prescription
2. **Prescription Detail**: Tapping on prescription doesn't open detail page yet
3. **Validation**: Could add more robust validation for medication dosages

## 🔐 Security

All data is protected by Row Level Security (RLS):

- Doctors can only see their own prescriptions
- Doctors can only create prescriptions for their consultations
- Patients will only see their own prescriptions (in patient app)

## 📦 Dependencies Used

Already in your project:

- `flutter_riverpod` - State management
- `supabase_flutter` - Database operations
- `intl` - Date formatting
- `equatable` - Entity equality

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Create database schema
- [x] Run SQL migrations
- [x] Create domain entities
- [x] Create data models
- [x] Create repository
- [x] Create providers
- [x] Create UI pages
- [x] Add to navigation
- [x] Integrate with video call flow

## 💡 Tips

1. **Testing**: Create a test prescription after a consultation to verify everything works
2. **Data**: Check Supabase dashboard to see prescriptions being created
3. **Errors**: Check console for any Supabase errors if prescription creation fails

## 📞 Integration with Video Calls

The prescription system is now integrated with the video call flow:

- When a call ends, the "Call Ended" screen shows
- Doctor can immediately create a prescription
- Prescription is linked to the consultation via `consultation_id`
- This maintains the relationship between call and prescription

# üîß CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED - Prescription Schema Mismatch

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THE PROBLEM

Your **database schema** and your **Flutter code** don't match!

### Database Schema (Current):

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.prescriptions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  health_record_id uuid,  -- Only has this reference
  created_at timestamp
);
```

### Flutter Code Expects:

```dart
'consultation_id': consultationId,
'patient_id': patientId,
'doctor_id': doctorId,
'diagnosis': diagnosis,
'symptoms': symptoms,
'medical_notes': medicalNotes,
'follow_up_date': followUpDate,
```

### Why Prescriptions Don't Appear:

1. **Insert fails silently** - Your code tries to insert columns that don't exist
2. **No prescription_id in consultation** - Even if created, consultation isn't updated
3. **Query fails** - Code tries to query by `doctor_id` column that doesn't exist

---

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION

Run the SQL script `FIX_PRESCRIPTION_SCHEMA.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.

This script will:

1. **Add missing columns** to prescriptions table:

   - `consultation_id`
   - `patient_id`
   - `doctor_id`
   - `diagnosis`
   - `symptoms`
   - `medical_notes`
   - `follow_up_date`
   - `updated_at`

2. **Create automatic trigger** to update `consultations.prescription_id` when prescription is created

3. **Add RLS policies** so doctors can only see their own prescriptions

4. **Add indexes** for better performance

---

## üöÄ HOW TO FIX (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script

1. Click **New Query**
2. **Copy the entire contents** of `FIX_PRESCRIPTION_SCHEMA.sql`
3. **Paste** into the SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Changes

Run this query to check if columns were added:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'prescriptions'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

**You should see:**

```
column_name        | data_type
-------------------+---------------------------
id                 | uuid
health_record_id   | uuid
created_at         | timestamp with time zone
consultation_id    | uuid                    ‚Üê NEW
patient_id         | uuid                    ‚Üê NEW
doctor_id          | uuid                    ‚Üê NEW
diagnosis          | text                    ‚Üê NEW
symptoms           | text                    ‚Üê NEW
medical_notes      | text                    ‚Üê NEW
follow_up_date     | timestamp with time zone ‚Üê NEW
updated_at         | timestamp with time zone ‚Üê NEW
```

### Step 4: Test Prescription Creation

1. **Open your Flutter app**
2. **Start a video call**
3. **Create a prescription**
4. **Check terminal logs**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Prescription inserted with ID: [uuid]
   ‚úÖ Prescription creation complete!
   ```
5. **Go to Prescriptions tab**
6. **Should see the prescription!** üéâ

### Step 5: Verify in Database

Run this query to see your prescriptions:

```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.diagnosis,
  p.consultation_id,
  p.created_at,
  c.prescription_id as consultation_has_prescription,
  u.full_name as patient_name
FROM prescriptions p
LEFT JOIN consultations c ON p.consultation_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON p.patient_id = u.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**You should see:**

- Your prescription with diagnosis
- `consultation_has_prescription` column showing the prescription ID (not null!)

## üìä WHAT THE TRIGGER DOES

After you run the SQL script, whenever a prescription is created:

```
1. Doctor creates prescription
   ‚Üì
2. Prescription inserted into database
   ‚Üì
3. **TRIGGER FIRES AUTOMATICALLY**
   ‚Üì
4. Consultation updated with prescription_id
   ‚Üì
5. Now consultations.prescription_id = prescriptions.id ‚úÖ
```

**Before (without trigger):**

```sql
consultations.prescription_id = NULL ‚ùå
```

**After (with trigger):**

```sql
consultations.prescription_id = 'abc-123-...' ‚úÖ
```

---

## üîç DEBUGGING AFTER FIX

### If prescriptions still don't appear:

1. **Check if columns were added:**

   ```sql
   \d prescriptions
   ```

2. **Check if trigger exists:**

   ```sql
   SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger
   WHERE tgrelid = 'prescriptions'::regclass;
   ```

   Should show: `trigger_update_consultation_prescription`

3. **Check RLS policies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'prescriptions';
   ```

   Should show 4 policies (view, create, update for doctors; view for patients)

4. **Create test prescription and check logs:**

   - If you see "‚úÖ Prescription inserted", the insert worked
   - If you see "üìã Prescriptions loaded: 0 items", check your doctor_id

5. **Verify doctor_id matches:**

   ```sql
   -- Get your doctor ID
   SELECT d.id FROM doctors d
   JOIN users u ON d.user_id = u.id
   WHERE u.auth_id = auth.uid();

   -- Check prescriptions with that doctor_id
   SELECT * FROM prescriptions WHERE doctor_id = '[paste-doctor-id-here]';
   ```

---

## üìù ALTERNATIVE: Manual Check

If you want to see what's happening step by step:

### 1. Before creating prescription:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prescriptions;
```

### 2. Create prescription in app

### 3. After creating prescription:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prescriptions;  -- Should increase by 1
```

### 4. Check the latest prescription:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prescriptions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### 5. Check if consultation was updated:

```sql
SELECT
  c.id as consultation_id,
  c.prescription_id,
  p.diagnosis
FROM consultations c
LEFT JOIN prescriptions p ON c.prescription_id = p.id
WHERE c.id = '[your-consultation-id]';
```

**If `prescription_id` is NULL**, the trigger didn't fire properly.

---

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULT

After running the SQL script:

‚úÖ **Prescriptions table** has all required columns  
‚úÖ **Trigger automatically** updates consultations  
‚úÖ **RLS policies** allow doctors to see their prescriptions  
‚úÖ **Indexes** make queries fast  
‚úÖ **Flutter app** can create and display prescriptions

---

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Run the ENTIRE SQL script** - Don't run parts of it separately
2. **health_record_id can be NULL** - We're not using health_records for now
3. **Old data won't be affected** - Only new prescriptions will work correctly
4. **No data loss** - This only ADDS columns, doesn't delete anything

---

## üìû QUICK TEST CHECKLIST

After running the SQL script:

- [ ] Columns added (check with `\d prescriptions`)
- [ ] Trigger created (check with pg_trigger query)
- [ ] RLS policies active (check with pg_policies query)
- [ ] Create test prescription in app
- [ ] Check logs for "‚úÖ Prescription inserted"
- [ ] Check Prescriptions tab - should see prescription
- [ ] Verify in database with SELECT query

---

## üí° WHY THIS HAPPENED

Your schema file shows the **original/simplified** structure:

```sql
prescriptions (id, health_record_id, created_at)
```

But your **Flutter code** was built for a more detailed structure:

```sql
prescriptions (id, consultation_id, patient_id, doctor_id, diagnosis, ...)
```

**Solution:** Update the database to match the code structure.

---

## üéâ FINAL STEP

**After running the SQL script:**

1. **Restart your Flutter app** (just to be safe)
2. **Create a test prescription**
3. **Watch the magic happen!** ‚ú®

The prescription should now:

- ‚úÖ Save to database successfully
- ‚úÖ Update the consultation automatically
- ‚úÖ Appear in prescriptions list immediately
- ‚úÖ Show all details (diagnosis, medications, tests)

---

**RUN THE SQL SCRIPT NOW!**

Open `FIX_PRESCRIPTION_SCHEMA.sql` and run it in Supabase SQL Editor.

Then test prescription creation again. It should work! üéä

# 🔧 FIXED: Doctor ID Issue

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Prescriptions were being created but not showing in the list.

**Root Cause**: The `doctorId` parameter was empty string `''` when creating prescriptions, so the prescription was saved with no doctor association.

**Solution**: Updated `video_call_page.dart` to get the actual doctor ID from `doctorProfileProvider`.

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `lib/features/video_call/presentation/pages/video_call_page.dart`

#### Added Import:

```dart
import '../../../doctor/presentation/providers/doctor_profile_provider.dart';
```

#### Updated "Create Prescription" Button:

```dart
ElevatedButton.icon(
  onPressed: () async {
    // Get doctor ID from provider
    final doctor = ref.read(doctorProfileProvider).value;
    if (doctor == null) {
      if (mounted) {
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          const SnackBar(
            content: Text('Doctor profile not loaded'),
            backgroundColor: Colors.red,
          ),
        );
      }
      return;
    }

    Navigator.of(context).push(
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => CreatePrescriptionPage(
          consultationId: widget.consultationId,
          patientId: widget.patientId ?? '',
          doctorId: doctor.id, // ✅ Now using actual doctor ID
          patientName: widget.patientName,
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
  icon: const Icon(Icons.medication),
  label: const Text('Create Prescription'),
)
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Hot Reload

In your terminal:

```bash
r  # Press 'r' to hot reload
```

### Step 2: Test the Flow

1. **Start a video call** with a patient
2. **End the call**
3. Click **"Create Prescription"** button
4. Fill in the form:
   - Diagnosis: `Common Cold`
   - Symptoms: `Fever, Cough, Headache`
   - Click **"+ Add Medication"**:
     - Name: `Paracetamol`
     - Dosage: `500mg`
     - Frequency: `Twice daily`
     - Duration: `3 days`
   - Click **"+ Add Test"** (optional):
     - Test: `Blood Test`
     - Reason: `Check infection`
     - Urgency: `Normal`
   - Select **Follow-up date** (optional)
5. Click **"Create Prescription"**

### Step 3: Verify It Shows Up

1. Go to **Prescriptions** tab (bottom navigation)
2. Your prescription should now appear! ✅
3. You should see:
   - Diagnosis: "Common Cold"
   - Date: Today's date
   - 1 medication
   - Number of tests (if added)

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fix:

- ❌ Prescription created but doesn't show in list
- ❌ `doctor_id` was `NULL` in database
- ❌ Error: "No prescriptions yet" even after creating one

### After Fix:

- ✅ Prescription appears immediately in the list
- ✅ `doctor_id` is properly set in database
- ✅ You can see all your prescriptions

## 🔍 Verify in Database

If you want to check in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check prescriptions with doctor_id
SELECT
  id,
  doctor_id,
  patient_id,
  diagnosis,
  created_at
FROM prescriptions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Should show doctor_id populated (not NULL)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing "No Prescriptions Yet"

**Check 1**: Did you run the schema migration?

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'prescriptions'
  AND column_name IN ('doctor_id', 'consultation_id', 'diagnosis');
```

Should return 3 rows. If not, run `update_existing_prescriptions_schema.sql`

**Check 2**: Is your doctor profile loaded?

```sql
-- Check your doctor exists
SELECT u.id as user_id, d.id as doctor_id, u.full_name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON d.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.auth_id = auth.uid();
```

Should show your doctor_id. If NULL, you need to create doctor profile.

**Check 3**: Did you hot reload the app?
Press `r` in the terminal where Flutter is running.

### Issue: "Doctor profile not loaded" error

**Solution**:

1. Restart the app (press `R` in terminal)
2. Make sure you're logged in as a doctor
3. Check that your doctor profile is complete

### Issue: Prescription created but with empty diagnosis

**Solution**:

- The `diagnosis` field is required
- Make sure you fill it before clicking "Create Prescription"
- If you see this, the validation should prevent creation

## ✨ What This Enables

Now that doctor_id is properly set:

✅ **List Prescriptions**: See all YOUR prescriptions
✅ **Filter by Doctor**: Only see prescriptions you created
✅ **Security**: RLS policies now work correctly
✅ **Analytics**: Can track prescriptions per doctor
✅ **Patient History**: Patients can see which doctor prescribed

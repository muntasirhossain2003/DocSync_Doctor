# Video Call on Web (Chrome) - Setup Guide

## üåê Camera/Microphone Permissions on Chrome

When running the DocSync Doctor app on **Chrome or any web browser**, you need to grant camera and microphone permissions through the browser, not through the app.

## ‚úÖ How to Fix: "Camera or microphone permission denied"

### Step 1: Check Browser Permissions

2. **Allow camera and microphone access** for your app
3. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)

### Step 2: Grant Permissions When Prompted

[Block] [Allow]
```

**Click "Allow"** ‚úÖ

### Step 3: If Permissions Were Previously Blocked

If you accidentally clicked "Block", follow these steps:

1. **Click the lock/camera icon** in the address bar
2. Find **Camera** and **Microphone** settings
3. Change from "Blocked" to **"Allow"**

## üö® Common Issues on Web

### Issue 1: "Permission denied" Error

**Symptoms:**

```
Failed to start call: Exception: Failed to initialize Agora:
Exception: Camera or microphone permission denied
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if permissions are blocked:**

   - Look for a ‚õî or camera icon with an X in the address bar
   - Click it and change to "Allow"

2. **Clear blocked permissions:**

   ```
   Chrome Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Privacy and security
   ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí View permissions and data stored across sites
   ‚Üí Find your app ‚Üí Remove
   ```

3. **Try incognito mode:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + N`
   - Test the video call there (will ask for permissions again)

### Issue 2: Camera/Mic Already in Use

**Symptoms:**

- "Device is already in use" error
- Black screen on video call

**Solutions:**

1. Close other apps using camera (Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc.)
2. Close other browser tabs using camera
3. Refresh your app page

### Issue 3: No Permission Prompt Appears

**Symptoms:**

- Browser doesn't ask for permissions
- Call fails silently

**Solutions:**

1. Check if permissions are already blocked
2. Enable permissions manually via site settings
3. Use HTTPS (not HTTP) - browsers require secure connection for camera/mic
4. Check if browser supports WebRTC

## üåê Browser Requirements

### Supported Browsers:

‚úÖ Chrome (recommended)  
‚úÖ Edge  
‚úÖ Firefox  
‚úÖ Safari (macOS/iOS)  
‚úÖ Opera

### Minimum Versions:

- Chrome: 74+
- Firefox: 66+
- Safari: 12.1+
- Edge: 79+

### Required:

- **HTTPS connection** (or localhost for development)
- **WebRTC support** enabled
- **JavaScript enabled**

---

## üîê For Development (localhost)

When running on **localhost** during development:

### Chrome Localhost Permissions

1. Chrome allows camera/mic on localhost without HTTPS
2. First time: Browser will ask for permissions
3. Grant permissions and they'll be saved
4. Refresh page if needed

### Testing on Local Network (192.168.x.x)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Accessing via IP address (not localhost) requires HTTPS!

**Option 1: Use localhost**

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-hostname=localhost --web-port=8080
```

**Option 2: Use HTTPS**
Generate a self-signed certificate for development

---

## üß™ Testing Permissions

### Check if Permissions Work:

1. **Test camera access:**

   - Open Chrome
   - Go to: https://webcamtests.com/
   - Click "Test my cam"
   - If your camera works here, permissions are OK

2. **Test microphone:**
   - Go to: https://webcammictest.com/check-mic.html
   - Click "Check mic"
   - Speak and see if levels move

If these work but your app doesn't, the issue is with Agora configuration, not permissions.

---

## üì± Mobile Web (Chrome on Android/iOS)

### Android Chrome:

1. Settings ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Camera/Microphone
2. Grant permissions to your app's URL

### iOS Safari:

1. Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Camera/Microphone
2. Allow for your app's website

---

## üêõ Debugging on Web

### Enable Console Logs:

1. Open Chrome DevTools: `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for error messages when starting call
4. Common errors:
   ```
   NotAllowedError: Permission denied
   NotFoundError: No camera/microphone found
   NotReadableError: Device is already in use
   ```

### Check Network:

1. Go to **Network** tab in DevTools
2. Start the call
3. Look for failed requests to Agora servers
4. Check if WebSocket connections are established

### Check WebRTC:

1. Open: `chrome://webrtc-internals/`
2. Start your video call
3. You'll see detailed WebRTC stats and connection info

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Changes Made

The following files were updated to support web:

### 1. `agora_service.dart`

```dart
// Skip permission request on web (browser handles it)
if (!kIsWeb) {
  await _requestPermissions();
}
```

### 2. Permission Handling

- Mobile: Uses `permission_handler` package
- Web: Browser's built-in permission system
- Automatic fallback if permission request fails

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### For Production Web App:

1. **Use HTTPS** (required for camera/mic access)

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **SSL Certificate** (Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, etc.)

3. **Update Agora Token**

   - Don't use static tokens in production
   - Implement dynamic token generation

4. **CORS Configuration**

   - Allow your domain in Agora project settings
   - Configure proper CORS headers

5. **PWA Manifest** (optional but recommended)
   ```json
   {
     "permissions": ["camera", "microphone"]
   }
   ```

---

## üìû Still Not Working?

### Fallback Options:

1. **Test on mobile app** instead of web

   ```bash
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```

2. **Use different browser** (try Firefox or Edge)

3. **Check Agora credentials:**

   - App ID correct?
   - Token valid?
   - Channel name consistent?

4. **Verify `.env` file loaded:**
   ```dart
   print('App ID: ${AgoraConfig.appId}');
   print('Token: ${AgoraConfig.token}');
   ```
